This project is for Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, in this project, i do some data exploration and visualisation on the dataset.
I connected the business or real world question to the data science tool on the data set and give my answer and analysis to the results.

I write a blog on Medium for my project, if you want to know more, please check the link below:
